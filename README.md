# NodeJS "Machine Learning" Ticket Bot

## Introduction

> This is my take on a very basic "machine learning" bot. It listens for questions with responses, and logs them. Then checks future questions to previously asked and responded oness.

> This is not really meant to be used, just putting here for applications or other items. However if anyone feels the need to use any of the code in this, please leave credit :)
